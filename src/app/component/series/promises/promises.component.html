        In Angular RxJS, a Promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be
        resolved in the future. Promises are used for asynchronous programming, where a task or operation may take some
        time to complete, and the result is not immediately available.

        A Promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a Promise is in the pending state, it means
        that the value is not yet available. When a Promise is fulfilled, it means that the value is available and the
        operation was successful. When a Promise is rejected, it means that an error occurred while trying to retrieve
        the value.
